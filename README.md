A software package to control Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity NMR spectrometers For some years now owners of Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity and CMX-InfinityPlus spectrometers have enjoyed the pleasures of Spinsight™ the software system that powers these instruments. While the spectrometer hardware continues to churn out quality NMR data concerns over software and the host computers have arisen. The Sun host computers running this software are quite old, repair parts are very difficult to obtain and support for them is essentially non-existent. A failure of the host computer can result in the loss of spectrometer functionality.

Since the host computer communicates to the spectrometer console through industry standard interfaces (ethernet and serial) replacement of the host computer with more modern and more powerful hardware can be accomplished without too much trouble. However, Spinsight™ development has ceased many years ago and installation tools have only been available for the original Sun host computers.

The Spinsight project here is a planned reboot of the original Spinsight™ software. The software archives have been dusted off and rebuilds are underway. Target hardware will certainly consist of Intel-based and equivalent. Target operating systems will certainly consist of certain Linux variants. Others will be considered and developed as possible.
