# spinsight
a software package to control Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity NMR spectrometers
For some years now owners of Chemagnetics CMX-Infinity and CMX-InfinityPlus spectrometers and Phoenix Data Acquisition Systems have enjoyed the pleasures of Spinsight™ the software system that powers these instruments. While the spectrometer hardware continues to churn out quality NMR data concerns over software have arisen. 
The Sun host computers running this software are quite old, repair parts are very difficult to obtain and support for them is essentially non-existent. Since the host computer communicates to the spectrometer console through industry standard interfaces (ethernet and serial) replacement of the host computer with more modern and more powerful hardware not an issue. However, Spinsight has not been available for installation on anything but the original host computers.
The spinsight project is a planned reboot of the original Spinsight™ software. 
More details will be published as they become available.
